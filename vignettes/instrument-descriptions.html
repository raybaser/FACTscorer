<p>This vignette includes descriptions of the major instruments scored by the FACTscorer (add link) package.</p>
<p>The original motivation for writing these descriptions was to ease the burden of writing research protocols for studies with quality of life (QOL) or other patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures as endpoints. Balances time with rigor needed.</p>
<p>Each description is written with sufficient detail to be included in formal research protocol documents that utilize the instrument as an outcome measure.</p>
<p>They are also suitable for the “Measures” subsection of manuscripts reporting the results of such studies (potentially with editing, to meet word limits). They were written with these purposes in mind, and follow the SCOPE guielines (RAY: check this, and add citations).</p>
<p>Each instrument description is complete with relevant references.</p>
<p>For protocols, the following modifications are needed: - Update in-text citation numbers and reference section. - State which of the multiple scored scales are of interest to the study objectives.</p>
<p>Please include the FACTscorer citation, or cite this vignette document. The reference for this vignette document is:</p>

<h3>FACT-G (General)</h3>
<p><strong>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G)</strong>, Version 4, is a 27-item questionnaire assessing the general quality of life (QOL) of cancer patients.<strong>[REF 1]</strong> It is considered appropriate for use with patients with any type of cancer.<strong>[REF 2]</strong> The questionnaire asks respondents to indicate the extent to which each item applied to them over “the past 7 days” using a 5-point Likert-type response format ranging from “0 - Not at all” to “4 - Very much”. It takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete.<strong>[REF 2]</strong></p>
<p>The 27 items produce 4 subscale scores corresponding to 4 primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 items, range 0 - 24), and Functional Well-Being (FWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28). The FACT-G Total Score is computed as the sum of the 4 subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 108. For all 5 scores, higher scores indicate better QoL. Details on scoring the FACT-G can be found at the official website, www.facit.org, where SAS and SPSS scoring algorithms are available for download. Additionally, the FACT-G can be scored in R using the “FACTscorer” package <strong>[REF 3]</strong>.</p>
<p>In the original validation study, the FACT-G subscales demonstrated good internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.69 (SWB) to 0.82 (PWB). The FACT-G Total Score reliability was 0.89. Additionally, the FACT-G Total Score and all subscale scores except SWB were sensitive to changes in performance status over time.<strong>[REF 1]</strong></p>

<h3>FACT-B (Breast)</h3>
<p><strong>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B)</strong>, Version 4, is a 37-item questionnaire designed to assess general quality of life (QOL) as well as symptoms and concerns specific to the QOL of patients with breast cancer.<strong>[REF 1]</strong> The questionnaire asks respondents to indicate the extent to which each item applied to them over “the past 7 days” using a 5-point Likert-type response format ranging from “0 - Not at all” to “4 - Very much”. It takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.<strong>[REF 2]</strong></p>
<p>The FACT-B consists of two parts - the 27-item FACT-General (FACT-G) plus 10 “Additional Concerns” items that assess concerns specific to patients with breast cancer. Together, these two parts produce a total of 8 scores: 5 subscale scores, 2 total scores, and one Trial Outcome Index (TOI).</p>
<p>The 27 FACT-G items produce the FACT-G Total Score and 4 subscale scores corresponding to 4 primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 items, range 0 - 24), and Functional Well-Being (FWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28). The FACT-G Total Score is computed as the sum of the 4 subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 108.<strong>[REF 3]</strong> The 10 “Additional Concerns” items produce the Breast Cancer Subscale (BCS) score (range 0 - 40). The FACT-B Total Score (range 0 - 148) is the sum of the 4 FACT-G subscale scores plus the BCS score. The FACT-B Trial Outcome Index (TOI, range 0 - 96) is the sum of the BCS score, the Physical Well-Being score, and the Functional Well-Being score. The TOI is a common endpoint in clinical trials because it can be more sensitive to changes in physical/functional status than the FACT-B Total Score, which includes the more stable Social and Emotional Well-Being domains.<strong>[REF 2]</strong> For all 8 scores, higher scores indicate better QoL. In the original validation study, the FACT-B demonstrated good internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.69 (SWB) to 0.86 (FWB) among the 4 general QOL subscales, 0.63 for the BCS, 0.90 for the FACT-B total score and 0.88 for the FACT-B TOI.<strong>[REF 1]</strong></p>
<p>More specific details on scoring the FACT-B can be found at the official website, www.facit.org, where SAS and SPSS scoring algorithms are available for download. Additionally, the FACT-B can be scored in R using the “FACTscorer” package.<strong>[REF 4]</strong></p>

<h3>FACT-Br (Brain)</h3>
<p><strong>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain (FACT-Br)</strong>, Version 4, is a 50-item questionnaire designed to assess general quality of life (QOL) as well as symptoms and concerns specific to the QOL of patients with brain malignancies.<strong>[REF 1]</strong> The questionnaire asks respondents to indicate the extent to which each item applied to them over “the past 7 days” using a 5-point Likert-type response format ranging from “0 - Not at all” to “4 - Very much”. It takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.<strong>[REF 2]</strong></p>
<p>The FACT-Br consists of two parts - the 27-item FACT-General (FACT-G) plus 23 “Additional Concerns” items that assess concerns specific to patients with brain malignancies. Together, these two parts produce a total of 8 scores: 5 subscale scores, 2 total scores, and one Trial Outcome Index (TOI).</p>
<p>The 27 FACT-G items produce the FACT-G Total Score and 4 subscale scores corresponding to 4 primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 items, range 0 - 24), and Functional Well-Being (FWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28). The FACT-G Total Score is computed as the sum of the 4 subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 108.<strong>[REF 3]</strong> The 23 “Additional Concerns” items produce the Brain Cancer Subscale (BrCS) score (range 0 - 92). The FACT-Br Total Score (range 0 - 200) is the sum of the 4 FACT-G subscale scores plus the BrCS score. The FACT-Br Trial Outcome Index (TOI, range 0 - 148) is the sum of the BrCS score, the Physical Well-Being score, and the Functional Well-Being score. The TOI is a common endpoint in clinical trials because it can be more sensitive to changes in physical/functional status than the FACT-Br Total Score, which includes the more stable Social and Emotional Well-Being domains.<strong>[REF 2]</strong> For all 8 scores, higher scores indicate better QoL. In the original validation study, the FACT-Br demonstrated good internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.69 (SWB) to 0.84 (FWB) among the 4 general QOL subscales and 0.83 for the BrCS.<strong>[REF 1]</strong></p>

<h3>FACT-H&amp;N (Head &amp; Neck)</h3>
<p><strong>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Head &amp; Neck (FACT-H&amp;N)</strong>, Version 4, is a 39-item questionnaire designed to assess general quality of life (QOL) as well as symptoms and concerns specific to the QOL of patients with head and neck cancer.<strong>[REF 1]</strong> The questionnaire asks respondents to indicate the extent to which each item applied to them over “the past 7 days” using a 5-point Likert-type response format ranging from “0 - Not at all” to “4 - Very much”. It takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.<strong>[REF 2]</strong></p>
<p>The FACT-H&amp;N consists of two parts - the 27-item FACT-General (FACT-G) plus 12 “Additional Concerns” items that assess concerns specific to patients with brain malignancies. Together, these two parts produce a total of 8 scores: 5 subscale scores, 2 total scores, and one Trial Outcome Index (TOI).</p>
<p>The 27 FACT-G items produce the FACT-G Total Score and 4 subscale scores corresponding to 4 primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 items, range 0 - 24), and Functional Well-Being (FWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28). The FACT-G Total Score is computed as the sum of the 4 subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 108.<strong>[REF 3]</strong> Of the 12 “Additional Concerns” items, 10 are scored to produce the Head &amp; Neck Cancer Subscale (HNCS) score (range 0 - 40). The FACT-H&amp;N Total Score (range 0 - 148) is the sum of the 4 FACT-G subscale scores plus the HNCS score. The FACT-H&amp;N Trial Outcome Index (TOI, range 0 - 96) is the sum of the HNCS score, the Physical Well-Being score, and the Functional Well-Being score. The TOI is a common endpoint in clinical trials because it can be more sensitive to changes in physical/functional status than the FACT-H&amp;N Total Score, which includes the more stable Social and Emotional Well-Being domains.<strong>[REF 2]</strong> For all 8 scores, higher scores indicate better QoL. In the original validation study, the FACT-H&amp;N demonstrated good internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.59 (SWB and EWB) to 0.79 (PWB) among the 4 general QOL subscales and 0.63 for the HNCS.<strong>[REF 1]</strong></p>
<p>More specific details on scoring the FACT-H&amp;N can be found at the official website, www.facit.org, where SAS and SPSS scoring algorithms are available for download. Additionally, the FACT-H&amp;N can be scored in R using the “FACTscorer” package.<strong>[REF 4]</strong></p>

The TOI is a common endpoint in clinical trials because it can be more sensitive to changes in physical/functional status than the FACT-NP Total Score, which includes the more stable Social and Emotional Well-Being domains.<strong>[REF 2]</strong> For all 8 scores, higher scores indicate better QoL.

<h3>FACT-O (Ovarian)</h3>
<p><strong>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Ovarian (FACT-O)</strong>, Version 4, is a 39-item questionnaire designed to assess general quality of life (QOL) as well as symptoms and concerns specific to the QOL of patients with ovarian cancer.<strong>[REF 1]</strong> The questionnaire asks respondents to indicate the extent to which each item applied to them over “the past 7 days” using a 5-point Likert-type response format ranging from “0 - Not at all” to “4 - Very much”. It takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.<strong>[REF 2]</strong></p>
<p>The FACT-O consists of two parts - the 27-item FACT-General (FACT-G) plus 12 “Additional Concerns” items that assess concerns specific to patients with ovarian cancer. Together, these two parts produce a total of 8 scores: 5 subscale scores, 2 total scores, and one Trial Outcome Index (TOI).</p>
<p>The 27 FACT-G items produce the FACT-G Total Score and 4 subscale scores corresponding to 4 primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 items, range 0 - 24), and Functional Well-Being (FWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28). The FACT-G Total Score is computed as the sum of the 4 subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 108.<strong>[REF 3]</strong> Of the 12 “Additional Concerns” items, 11 are scored to produce the Ovarian Cancer Subscale (OCS) score (range 0 - 44). The FACT-O Total Score (range 0 - 152) is the sum of the 4 FACT-G subscale scores plus the OCS score. The FACT-O Trial Outcome Index (TOI, range 0 - 100) is the sum of the OCS score, the Physical Well-Being score, and the Functional Well-Being score. The TOI is a common endpoint in clinical trials because it can be more sensitive to changes in physical/functional status than the FACT-O Total Score, which includes the more stable Social and Emotional Well-Being domains.<strong>[REF 2]</strong> For all 8 scores, higher scores indicate better QoL. In the original validation study, the FACT-O demonstrated good internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.75 (SWB) to 0.88 (PWB) among the 4 general QOL subscales and 0.92 for the OCS.<strong>[REF 1]</strong></p>
<p>More specific details on scoring the FACT-O can be found at the official website, www.facit.org, where SAS and SPSS scoring algorithms are available for download. Additionally, the FACT-O can be scored in R using the “FACTscorer” package.<strong>[REF 4]</strong></p>

<h3>FACT-AntiA (Anti-Angiogenesis)</h3>
<p><strong>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Anti-Angiogenesis (FACT-AntiA)</strong> Version 4, is a 50-item questionnaire designed to assess general quality of life (QOL) as well as symptoms and concerns specific to the QOL of patients receiving Anti-Angiogenesis therapy.<strong>[REF 1]</strong> The questionnaire asks respondents to indicate the extent to which each item applied to them over “the past 7 days” using a 5-point Likert-type response format ranging from “0 - Not at all” to “4 - Very much”. It takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.<strong>[REF 2]</strong></p>
<p>The FACT-AntiA consists of two parts - the 27-item FACT-General (FACT-G) plus 23 “Additional Concerns” items that assess concerns specific to patients receiving Anti-Angiogenesis therapy. Together, these two parts produce a total of 8 scores: 5 subscale scores, 2 total scores, and one Trial Outcome Index (TOI).</p>
<p>The 27 FACT-G items produce the FACT-G Total Score and 4 subscale scores corresponding to 4 primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 items, range 0 - 24), and Functional Well-Being (FWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28). The FACT-G Total Score is computed as the sum of the 4 subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 108.<strong>[REF 3]</strong> The 23 “Additional Concerns” items produce the Anti-Angiogenesis Subscale (AntiA) score (range 0 - 92). The FACT-AntiA Total Score (range 0 - 200) is the sum of the 4 FACT-G subscale scores plus the AntiA score. The FACT-AntiA Trial Outcome Index (TOI, range 0 - 148) is the sum of the AntiA score, the Physical Well-Being score, and the Functional Well-Being score. The TOI is a common endpoint in clinical trials because it can be more sensitive to changes in physical/functional status than the FACT-AntiA Total Score, which includes the more stable Social and Emotional Well-Being domains.<strong>[REF 2]</strong> For all 8 scores, higher scores indicate better QoL. In the original validation study, the FACT-AntiA demonstrated good internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from ? () to ? () among the 4 general QOL subscales and ? for the AntiA<strong>[REF 1]</strong></p>

The TOI is a common endpoint in clinical trials because it can be more sensitive to changes in physical/functional status than the FAACT Total Score, which includes the more stable Social and Emotional Well-Being domains.<strong>[REF 2]</strong> For all 8 scores, higher scores indicate better QoL. In the original validation study, the FAACT demonstrated good internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.74 (SWB and EWB) to 0.77 (FWB) among the 4 general QOL subscales and 0.77 for the ACS.<strong>[REF 1]</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Abdominal Discomfort (FACIT-AD)</strong>, Version 4, is a 30-item questionnaire designed to assess general quality of life (QOL) as well as symptoms and concerns specific to the QOL of patients with abdominal discomfort.<strong>[REF 1]</strong> The questionnaire asks respondents to indicate the extent to which each item applied to them over “the past 7 days” using a 5-point Likert-type response format ranging from “0 - Not at all” to “4 - Very much”. It takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.<strong>[REF 2]</strong></p>
<p>The FACIT-AD consists of two parts - the 27-item FACT-General (FACT-G) plus 3 “Additional Concerns” items that assess concerns specific to patients with abdominal discomfort. Together, these two parts produce a total of 8 scores: 5 subscale scores, 2 total scores, and one Trial Outcome Index (TOI).</p>
<p>The 27 FACT-G items produce the FACT-G Total Score and 4 subscale scores corresponding to 4 primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 items, range 0 - 24), and Functional Well-Being (FWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28). The FACT-G Total Score is computed as the sum of the 4 subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 108.<strong>[REF 3]</strong> The 3 “Additional Concerns” items produce the Abdominal Discomfort Subscale (ADS) score (range 0 - 12). The FACIT-AD Total Score (range 0 - 120) is the sum of the 4 FACT-G subscale scores plus the ADS score. The FACIT-AD Trial Outcome Index (TOI, range 0 - 68) is the sum of the ADS score, the Physical Well-Being score, and the Functional Well-Being score. The TOI is a common endpoint in clinical trials because it can be more sensitive to changes in physical/functional status than the FACIT-AD Total Score, which includes the more stable Social and Emotional Well-Being domains.<strong>[REF 2]</strong> For all 8 scores, higher scores indicate better QoL.

<h3>FACT-N (Neutropenia)</h3>
<p><strong>The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Neutropenia (FACT-N)</strong>, Version 4, is a 46-item questionnaire designed to assess general quality of life (QOL) as well as symptoms and concerns specific to the QOL of patients with neutropenia.<strong>[REF 1]</strong> The questionnaire asks respondents to indicate the extent to which each item applied to them over “the past 7 days” using a 5-point Likert-type response format ranging from “0 - Not at all” to “4 - Very much”. It takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.<strong>[REF 2]</strong></p>
<p>The FACT-N consists of two parts - the 27-item FACT-General (FACT-G) plus 19 “Additional Concerns” items that assess concerns specific to patients with neutropenia. Together, these two parts produce a total of 8 scores: 5 subscale scores, 2 total scores, and one Trial Outcome Index (TOI).</p>
<p>The 27 FACT-G items produce the FACT-G Total Score and 4 subscale scores corresponding to 4 primary QOL domains: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 items, range 0 - 24), and Functional Well-Being (FWB, 7 items, range 0 - 28). The FACT-G Total Score is computed as the sum of the 4 subscale scores and ranges from 0 to 108.<strong>[REF 3]</strong> The 19 “Additional Concerns” items produce the Neutropenia Subscale (NS) score (range 0 - 76). The FACT-N Total Score (range 0 - 184) is the sum of the 4 FACT-G subscale scores plus the NS score. The FACT-N Trial Outcome Index (TOI, range 0 - 132) is the sum of the NS score, the Physical Well-Being score, and the Functional Well-Being score. The TOI is a common endpoint in clinical trials because it can be more sensitive to changes in physical/functional status than the FACT-N Total Score, which includes the more stable Social and Emotional Well-Being domains.<strong>[REF 2]</strong> For all 8 scores, higher scores indicate better QoL. In the original validation study, the FACT-N demonstrated good internal consistency reliability, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from 0.70 (EWB) to 0.87 (FWB) among the 4 general QOL subscales and 0.84 for the NS.<strong>[REF 1]</strong></p>
<p>More specific details on scoring the FACT-N can be found at the official website, www.facit.org, where SAS and SPSS scoring algorithms are available for download. Additionally, the FACT-N can be scored in R using the “FACTscorer” package.<strong>[REF 4]</strong></p>
