Description: Provides functions to score the Functional Assessment of Cancer
    Therapy (FACT) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)
    family of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures.  The questionnaires
    themselves can be downloaded from www.FACIT.org.  For most of the FACIT
    questionnaires, FACIT.org provides scoring syntax for use with commercial
    statistical software (SAS and SPSS).  The FACTscorer R package is intended
    to serve as a free, reliable alternative for those without access to SAS or
    SPSS.  Additionally, it enables R users to both score and analyze the
    FACT and FACIT scales in R, avoiding the time-consuming and error-prone
    process of transferring data back-and-forth between statistical software.
    Finally, use of the FACTscorer package will prevent many sources of scoring
    error common when using SAS and/or SPSS syntax (e.g., copy-paste errors and
    other accidental modifications to the syntax).
